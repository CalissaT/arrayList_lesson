ArrayLists are only 2.5%-7.5% but have many concepts from other units and are a good data structure to know. . 7.1 Introduction to ArrayList . Arrays ArrayLists . Static (fixed size) | Dynamic (can change size) | . Fundamental java feature | Part of a framework. Someone was nice and designed this with the behind the scenes being arrays | . An object with no methods | A class with many methods | . Not as flexible | Designed to be more flexible | . Can store more primitive data | Not designed to store primitives, they store object references | . | Slightly slower than Arrays | . | Can only be used with an import statement | . Real Life Array Example: You always have to have five players on the court .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
