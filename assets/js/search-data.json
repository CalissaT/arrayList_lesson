            "content": "Lesson Purpose and Objectives . Learn about the structure and functions of an arrayList and go over the key College Board concepts for arrayLists . ArrayLists are only 2.5%-7.5% but have many concepts from other units and are a good data structure to know. Also, the 3rd question of the FRQ is based on ArrayLists . 7.1 Introduction to ArrayList . Arrays ArrayLists . Static (fixed size) | Dynamic (can change size) | . Fundamental java feature | Part of a framework. Someone was nice and designed this with the behind the scenes being arrays | . An object with no methods | A class with many methods | . Not as flexible | Designed to be more flexible | . Can store more primitive data | Not designed to store primitives, they store object references | . | Slightly slower than Arrays | . | Can only be used with an import statement | . Real Life Array Example: You always have to have five players on the court . Real Life ArrayList Example: In dodgeball, the number of people in the game is changing based on who comes in or gets out . Primitive Data Types: . boolean | char | double | int | . Wrapper Class Data Types (Store the primitive values as objects) . Boolean | Character | Double | Integer | . import java.util.ArrayList; //you must import the java.util package // Instantiating: ArrayList&lt;DataType&gt; variableName = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(n); //DataType must be nonprimitive data type public class introArrayList { public static void main (String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; e1 = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); //empty ArrayList&lt;String&gt; e2 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(5); //5 elements ArrayList&lt;Dogs&gt; e3 = new ArrayList&lt;Dogs&gt;(); //you can store whatever objects you want } } . 7.2 ArrayList Methods . There are a lot of cool methods that you can use with arrayLists, but here are the ones College Board wants you to know for 7.2: . size(); . Returns the number of elements in the list | . add(obj); . Adds element at the end | . add(index, object); . Adds element at specific index | . remove(index); . Removes element from specific index | . set(index, object); . Replaces element at index with new object | . get(index); . Returns element at index | . import java.util.ArrayList; public class methodsArrayList { public static void main (String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; dogs = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;Sparky&quot;, &quot;Duke&quot;, &quot;Noodle&quot;)); ArrayList&lt;String&gt; dogs2 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;Sparky&quot;, &quot;Duke&quot;, &quot;Noodle&quot;)); System.out.println(&quot;There are &quot; + dogs.size() + &quot; in the ArrayList&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;There are &quot; + dogs2.size() + &quot; in the ArrayList&quot;); //objects you add must be of the same data type dogs.add(&quot;Peanut&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;There are now &quot; + dogs.size() + &quot; dogs in the ArrayList&quot;); String myDog = dogs.get(2); System.out.println(&quot;My dog is named &quot; + myDog); } } //Note: you don&#39;t need to declare &lt;String&gt; again after new ArrayList methodsArrayList.main(null); . There are 3 in the ArrayList There are 3 in the ArrayList There are now 4 dogs in the ArrayList My dog is named Noodle . //Hmmmm... seems suspect import java.util.ArrayList; public class example { public static void main (String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt; questions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); questions.add(true); questions.add(false); myMethod(questions); } public static void myMethod(ArrayList arr) { if (arr.size()&gt;0) { arr.set(0,&quot;Hello&quot;); //String with boolean??? Uh oh! System.out.println(arr.get(0)); } } } example.main(null); . Hello . import java.util.ArrayList; public class example { public static void main (String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt; questions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); questions.add(true); questions.add(false); myMethod(questions); } public static void myMethod(ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt; arr) { if (arr.size()&gt;0) { arr.set(0,&quot;Hello&quot;); //String with boolean??? Uh oh! System.out.println(arr.get(0)); } } } example.main(null); //Make sure to specify data type so the compiler is more helpful and it avoids confusion //This also applies for returning and arrayList as well . | arr.set(0,&#34;Hello&#34;); //String with boolean??? Uh oh! incompatible types: java.lang.String cannot be converted to java.lang.Boolean . //Returning an ArrayList public static ArrayList methodName (ArrayList arr){ return arr; } . // HACK!!!! // Create an arrayList and use one of the cool methods for it import java.util.ArrayList; public class hack1 { public static void main (String[] args) { } } hack1.main(null); . 7.3 Traversing ArrayLists . 7.4 Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists . 7.5 Searching . Often times we need to find locate data inside linear structures Normally we would use for loops in order to specify each element. one at a time, and do not need to track the index after execution. | . for ( int index = 0; index &lt; items.size(); index++ ){ //forward searching if ( items.get(index) == num ){ return index; } } . 7.6 Sorting . 7.7 Ethical Issues Around Data Collection .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
